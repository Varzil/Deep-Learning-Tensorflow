    "\n",
    "        - To reshape the arrays (going from 784 to 28x28), you can use functions such as [`np.array_split`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array_split.html) or [`np.reshape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html).\n",
    "\n",

    "   - 2. The other one is to use `np.loadtxt`. You can find the documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
